 <p><b>Activity Constructor Prompt 2<br>Guidelines:</b><br>Solving the activity question should prompt students to<br><ol type=\"i\"><li>observe</li><li>identify relationships between variables</li><li>come up with their own hypothesis of the phenomenon/process they are observing for the first time through visualization</li></ol>

<p><b>Activity Construction Prompt 2: Frame Peer Instruction (PI) activity question<br>Guidelines:</b><br> <ol type=\"A\"><li>Frame a Peer-Instruction (PI) question :<br><ol type=\"i\"> <li>Whose solution can be shown through the visualization i.e. the effect of changing variable values on the system</li> <li>Solving the PI activity question should require students to: <ol type=\"a\"> <li>Observe.</li> <li>Identify relationships between variables.</li> <li>Come up with their own hypothesis of the phenomenon/process they are observing for the first time through visualization.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Frame questions that target the difficult part you had identified before.</li> <li>Questions & the multiple answer options should be brief but not leading.</li> <li>Thus, deliverable from this question should be hypothesis.</li> </ol></li> <li>Decide which visualization feature(s) you will use to show feedback to this PI question.</li></ol></p>

<p><b>Activity Construction Prompt 3: Breakdown the process into 'individual components' or modules<br>Guidelines:</b>Decompose the process, that needs to be adopted to travel from given input to the given output, into steps like<br><ul><li>Identify the constituent steps/components of the process.</li><li>Sequence them in proper order to get the required output.</li></ul>
p9 
<p><b>Activity Construction Prompt 3: Decide what multiple condition sets to show students through visualization<br>Guidelines:</b><br><ul><li>You need to play the visualization to show effect of varying the value (s) of multiple variables on the system.</li><li> This will help the students to gain conceptual understanding of the system.</li><li> Therefore, decide which input parameters (variable values) you will vary to show output effect.</li><li>If you have video/animation, ensure it shows the different variations addressing guidelines 1-3 above.</li><li>If you have a video/animation, note the timestamps in your lesson plan where you need to pause to show each condition</li></ul></p>

<p><b>Activity Construction Prompt 3: Decide what multiple condition sets to show students through visualization<br><br> Guidelines:</b> <ul> <li>You need to play the visualization to show effect of varying the value (s) of causal variables on the system.</li> <li>This will help the students to identify the strength and directionality of relationship between different causal variables</li> <li>Therefore, decide which input parameters (variable values) you will vary to show output effect on which variable values.</li> <li>If you have a video/animation, note the timestamps in your lesson plan where you need to pause to show each condition</li></ul></p>

<p><b>Activity Constructor Prompt 4: Frame the TPS activity question such that it is mapped to your objective<br>Guidelines for framing the activity question.<br></b><ul><li>Frame a parent question whose solution can be shown through the visualization.</li><li>Give clear guideline to students that will prompt them to identify & execute each of the modules/ knowledge components identified in previous step.</li><li>Give all identification steps as individual activity of 'Think' phase.</li><li>Give the sequencing & execution of the identified steps as group activity of 'Pair' phase.</li></ul>

<p><b>Activity Construction Prompt 4: Frame activity question<br>Guidelines:</b><br>Frame a parent activity question on multiple representation whose solution can be shown through the visualization i.e.<br>Choose those parameters in one representation (e.g. graph or equation or model) whose values you can change visually through check boxes or slider bars or video capture etc.<br>Solving the parent activity question should ideally require students to do both :<br><ul><li>Relate corresponding parts in the 2 representations</li><li>Translate 1 representation into the other.</li></ul></p>
P11a
<p><b>Activity Constructor Prompt 4: Decide the parent activity question<br>Guidelines:</b><br>Frame a parent activity question for prediction whose solution can be shown through the visualization i.e.<br>Choose those variables whose values you can change visually through checkboxes or slider bars or video capture etc.<br>Solving the parent activity question should ideally require students to do both :<br><ul><li> Identify the causal relationship between variables.</li><li>Conceptualize the working model of the system themselves.</li></ul></p>
p12
<p><b>Activity Constructor Prompt 4: Frame the PI activity question that addresses the difficult part identified<br><br>Guidelines:</b><br> <ul> <li>Frame questions that addresses the difficult part you had identified.</li><li>Question whose solution can be shown through visualization.</li><li>Question should prompt students to look for covariation among variables.</li><li>Question & Answer options should be brief.</li><li>The clear deliverable should be student illustration of the concept/working principle.</li><li>You can consult questions from existing question banks like:<a href=\"http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca/resources/clickers.htm#questions\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca/resources/clickers.htm#questions</a></li></ul></p>

<p><b>Topic = Travelling Saleman Problem</b><br> If <b>parent question</b> to solve with visualization is:<br>Construct a minimum cost tour given a graph.<br> Then,<br><b>Think phase:</b> Think (individually) <br>Constuct the MST<br></p><p><b>Pair Phase:</b> Look into your neighbor's answers<br><ol type="a"><li>Discuss if you do not agree with your friendâ€™s answers</li><li>You can also change your answer</li><li>Together, try to draw the transformed signal </li><li>Give reasons </li></ol><br><b>Share phase:</b> Look at the visualization<br><ol type="a"><li>Compare your answer with what is shown</li><li>Underline the errors  you found in your solution</li><li>Visualization feature used = Checkboxes & Slider Bars</li></ol></p>
